Place these files in ```jamroom/modules/tmpHelloWorld```

Once logged in as master admin, goto: ```http://localhost/jamroom/modules/tmpHelloWorld/hello.php``` to access the hello.php file. 

Or ```http://localhost/jamroom/hello/sayhellotome``` to call the ```view_tmpHelloWorld_sayhellotome()``` function from index.php.
